WellMap - Live Webpage Branch
=======

### <style color="##ff0000">DO NOT</style>

* Do not, under any circumstances, touch any of the jquery or jquery-ui files.  That includes external/jquery.
  * The same goes for Semantics-UI
  * And gmaps.js stuff
  * I mean...  Look, but don't touch...


Browser-based Oil Well maping software for 4th year Engineering Group Project.

Website: [team-avengineers.github.io/WellMap/](http://team-avengineers.github.io/WellMap/)

Early Prototype UI is [locally hosted](http://team-avengineers.github.io/WellMap/ui_proto.html)

[QUnit Test Suite](http://team-avengineers.github.io/WellMap/qunit)

Working Test stuff currently hosted at [tconx.net/wellmap](http://tconx.net/wellmap/)

Current Phase(s):
* Planning
* Research/Learning
* Experimenting
	

Languages:

* JavaScript w/ JQuery for the bulk of it
* DB management with PHP and MySQL
* Ruby(?)
	* Should look into it.  I'm not even completely sure at this point what Ruby is or what's so special about it...

Libraries:

* UI
	* [Jquery UI](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui)
	* [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)
* Map
	* [gmaps.js](https://github.com/hpneo/gmaps)
	* [jsclass](https://github.com/jcoglan/jsclass) - This one is iffy, might just be better off writing our own data structures as needed, or using a different library...
